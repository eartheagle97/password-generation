# Password Generator

## Project Overview

This Password Generator is a web application designed to create strong and secure passwords based on user-selected criteria. It allows users to include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their passwords. The application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend and employs state-of-the-art web development practices to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Criteria:** Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their passwords.
- **Adjustable Length:** The length of the password can be adjusted using a slider.
- **Password History:** The application keeps a history of generated passwords for the user's session.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Users can easily copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

## How It Works

The application generates a password based on the selected criteria. Users can choose the types of characters to include and adjust the length of the password. Once the criteria are set, the application will generate a password that matches the user's selections.
